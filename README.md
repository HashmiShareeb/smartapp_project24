# smartapp_project24

For this project, I made a timetable app that shows the timetable of each course (which is simulated). This app is made with Flutter, using the calender_view package to display the timetable. I also used firebase for the user authentication and firebase as the database to store the added event from each user. This was a project I had to make in the class called SmartApp Development, where we use Flutter and Dart to make a mobile application.
